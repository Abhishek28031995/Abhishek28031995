- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abhishek Pathak (@Abhishek28031995) from Pune
- ðŸ‘€ I am working at Barclays, Pune as an Data Scientist. I have handled end-to-end lifecycle for projects related to NLP, sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, OCR, data analysis, and forecasting using predictive analytics tools like Python, Tableau, SQL, and Advance Excel. Have also gained a handful of experience in solving complex business problems related to sales, marketing, or production across various domains like chemicals, helathcare, banking, manufacturing, etc. I am well-versed with knowledge about (AI) Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, techniques like hypothesis testing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), data pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, data visualization, and ML algorithms. From not having much exposure to programming to doing numerous projects on Data Analytics and Machine Learning in a span of 3 years, it has been an amazing and insightful experience!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently uprgrading my Deep Learning skills. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects across different industries where I can leverage my Business and Technical knowledge.
